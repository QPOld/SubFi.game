Welcome to SubFi!
===================

0.0.1b

# SubFi.game 

A turn based mmo inspired by Hearthstone and Path of Exile.
Players will evolve their character with strategic player verse player action.
The player verse player mode will be similar to a hearthstone match except that the 'deck of cards' is replaced with the player's character with their given skill set.
The character skill set is very aligned with the complexity of the Path of Exile skill tree but take even further.
The player will determine the character stats and skills for each build, allowing each character to be a unique 'deck of cards'.
The game is written in a MEPNS (MongoDB, Express, Phaser.io, Node.js, Socket.io) stack.
The old framework is being rewritten in the Phaser.io framework.
As of right now the game will be hosted at [SubFi.info](https://www.subfi.info/).
The server will eventually be migrated to a 3rd party hosting company upon final release.
