# SubFi.game 
A turn based mmo inspired by Hearthstone and Path of Exile.
As of right now the game will be hosted at [SubFi.info](https://www.subfi.info/).
The server will eventually be migrated to a 3rd party hosting company upon final release.

The game is in a very early alpha stage.

> **Note:**
> - The entire game is being rewritten with the Phaser.io framework.
> - All game art will be recreated with default open source art.
> - Account creation will be closed until the next open alpha test.
